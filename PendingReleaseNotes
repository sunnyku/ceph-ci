>=15.2.5
--------

* CephFS: Automatic static subtree partitioning policies may now be configured
  using the new distributed and random ephemeral pinning extended attributes on
  directories. See the documentation for more information:
  https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/cephfs/multimds/

* Monitors now have a config option ``mon_osd_warn_num_repaired``, 10 by default.
  If any OSD has repaired more than this many I/O errors in stored data a
 ``OSD_TOO_MANY_REPAIRS`` health warning is generated.

* Now when noscrub and/or nodeep-scrub flags are set globally or per pool,
  scheduled scrubs of the type disabled will be aborted. All user initiated
  scrubs are NOT interrupted.
